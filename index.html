                <p>Hypatia was the first ever woman - and at her time, the world's leading - mathematician 
                    and astronomer. She taught mathematics, astronomy and philosophy in Alexandria, Egypt. Sadly,
                    her Neoplatonist philosophical views and teachings led to her tragic death - she was
                    brutally murdered by a group of Christian zealots.</p>

                        of Chinese astronomy. Despite the feudal customs that inhibited women's rights at the time,
                        she educated herself and actively researched, contributing several articles on mathematics and astronomy (including one explaining the

                            that enabled us to measure distances to faraway galaxies and with that, better understand
                            its structure and evolution.

                        <p>Vera Rubin studied rotation curves on galaxies and first noticed the discrepancy
                            between the predicted and observed motion of the stars near the edges of
                            the galaxies, an observation that was the first direct evidence of the 
                            existence of dark matter. She has received numerous honorary doctorates
                            and awards for her work.
